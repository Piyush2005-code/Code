/*
Given a list L of Linked-Lists, Find 
The number of pairs of heads that LEAD TO A HIT
The number of pairs of heads that LEAD TO A FORK
The number of pairs of heads that STAY APART

Ordering of the heads in a pair is insignificant.

2 Linked List heads h1 and h2 are said to - 
LEAD TO A FORK if a common node (other than h1 and h2) is reachable from both of them.
STAY APART if they do not LEAD TO A FORK and neither of the heads is reachable from the other. Formally, h1 cannot be reached from h2 and h2 cannot be reached from h1.
LEAD TO A HIT if either h1 is reachable from h2, or h2 is reachable from h1

Each node a is uniquely described by it’s id a_i

Input format : 
You just need to complete the function void printHitForkApart(vector& L)
which accepts a vector of Linked List objects (class description provided).

Output format : 
Print three integers in a newline : 
The number of pairs of heads that LEAD TO A HIT,
The number of pairs of heads that LEAD TO A FORK,
The number of pairs of heads that STAY APART

Constraints : 
1 <= |L| <= 100
1 <= a_i <= 1e9
All nodes have distinct id
You may assume that none of the linked lists contain a cycle
Heads of all linked lists are unique

Input (Console, if you’re willing to test on additional test cases) : 
First line contains integer n = |L|
Each of the n lines that follow describe n linked lists : 
Line i (1<=i<=n) contains m as the first integer (length of the linked list), the head’s id as the second integer, while the remaining m-1 integers represent the id’s of the elements succeeding the head in order.

Example:
7
6 1 2 3 4 5 6
4 3 4 5 6
5 7 3 4 5 6
1 6
3 8 9 6
3 12 13 14
5 10 11 12 13 14

Precisely, 
L = [[1,2,3,4,5,6,NULL],
     [3,4,5,6,NULL],
     [7,3,4,5,6,NULL],
     [6,NULL],
     [8,9,6,NULL],
     [12,13,14,NULL],
     [10,11,12,13,14,NULL]]	

// Input reading and creation of Linked List vector is already done for you, please focus on completing the function only.

Output
7
4
10

Node 1 and Node 3 hit
Node 1 and Node 6 hit
Node 3 and Node 7 hit
Node 3 and Node 6 hit
Node 7 and Node 6 hit
Node 6 and Node 8 hit
Node 12 and Node 10 hit

Nodes 1 and 7 fork at node 3
Nodes 1 and 8 fork at node 6
Nodes 3 and 8 fork at node 6
Nodes 7 and 8 fork at node 6

All other remaining pairs of heads stay apart
